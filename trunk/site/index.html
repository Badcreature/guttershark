		<h1>Guttershark - Actionscript 3 Library</h1>
		<h3 class='first'>WHAT THE FUCK?</h3>
		<p>I know what you're thinking. Another Library? Hear me out - Guttershark is a library that pushes
			convention to make you faster as a developer. Numerous other AS3 libraries are out there but
			they all try to push insane amounts of abstraction on you.</p>
		<p>Just because something can be abstracted, doesn't mean it should be. All these libraries
			implement about every design pattern you can find, just because they can. Does that make it more
			useful? Probably not.</p>
		<p>If something that is so abstracted is supposed to so useful, why does it take so long just to
			implement some really basic functionality?</p>
		<p>So what's the deal with Guttershark? Everything in the Guttershark library is abstract enough
			that you can piece something together with the libraries included. But the real benefit comes
			from using the conventions defined by it. The biggest benefit is the amount of time it takes
			to get up and running with a complete site.</p>
		<p>By following the conventions, you can override literally
			one method, write about 6 lines of code, and have the following implemented:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Loads a "site XML" file.</li>
			<li>Site XML parsers for simplification and convention of data extraction.</li>
			<li>Preloading Framework.</li>
			<li>Bandwidth Detection (High/Med/Low).</li>
			<li>CPU Speed Estimation (Fast/Med/Slow).</li>
			<li>Online Status Pinging.</li>
			<li>Akamai Ident Service Integration.</li>
			<li>Akamai Net Connection Manager for FLVPlayback components.</li>
			<li>Simplified Keyboard Event Management.</li>
			<li>Simplified Language Management.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All of the above options are determined by an opt-in system through FlashVars.</p>
		<p>So, by conforming to some pretty loose conventions, you get a lot of things for free, and still
			have plenty of room to implement anything else you wish.</p>
		<h3>DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY</h3>
		<p>My philosophy behind documentation is that it should make sense, and allow me to tell someone to
			look at the API docs, and not have to answer any questions.</p>
		<p>How can that happen? By having an extremely well documented API. 95% of classes have examples, and explain
			things in a readable fashion. The guide for writing documentation for Guttershark has been the Flash API.
			What can makes more sense than following how Adobe does it?</p>
		</p>Documentation is always updated and maintained.</p>
		<h2>DOCUMENTATION</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.guttershark.net/docs/" name="documentation">API Docs</a></a>
		<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
		<a href="#" name="examples" style="display:none">examples</a>
		<p>All examples are in the SVN repository. Add a flash class path that points to the Guttershark "lib/as" directory and
			all examples will publish out of the box.</p>
