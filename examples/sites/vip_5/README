The VIP_5 Site example has all it's class dependencies bundles in the classes folder. Including
a version of Guttershark. The version of Guttershark in the classes folder has slight differences
from the trunk version of guttershark, the differences aren't that big, but there is still
an archived version of guttershark bundled with the example so that there is no maintanence on
keeping the example running.
