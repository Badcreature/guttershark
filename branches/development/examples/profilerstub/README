The profilerstub is a stub FLEX SWF that makes an attempt to load ./main.swf.
When this happens successfully, the swf is added to the stage. You can then use 
FlexBuilder to launch and external application for profiling. In this example, 
you can target deploy/profilerstub.swf

howto:
In Flex Builder, switch to the flex profiling perspective. Then go to
Profile>Profile External Application>New...>Browse... (select the swf deploy/profilerstub.swf).

Then you can select if from the list and select "Launch"

Note that you need Flex Builder Pro to do any of this.
